# This is the classic Sudoku game

##How to play:
click on the field you want to place your number in \
or move through the grid using the arrow keys \
\
type in your number: \
grey --> stored for you and ready to be filled in by hitting enter \
black --> number is filled in, hit backspace to delete\

use the sudoku solver:\
hit spacebar and it will use backtracking to try to solve the sudoku grid\

maybe coming soon:\
a timer, some sort of scoring, creating a random grid based on levels(easy, normal, hard)
